# STM32 Experiments
This repository contains experimental projects for Model A anapad R&D. These projects use the STM32CubeMX to generate the code and project files for the [STM32F072RBT6 Discovery development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f072bdiscovery.html) with the MDK-ARM toolchain.
